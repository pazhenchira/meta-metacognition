# Meta-Metacognition - App Orchestrator

> Self-contained app orchestrator generated by engine v2.0.7 on 2025-12-21.

## PRE-FLIGHT (every turn)
1. Read `.app/essence.md`
2. Read `app_intent.md`
3. Read `.app/roles/_manifest.md` and role files
4. Read `.app/workflows/`
5. Confirm runtime in `meta_config.json`

## Runtime
- preferred_runtime: codex-cli-mcp
- enable_subagents: true
- codex_subagent_mode: mcp-workers
- mcp_tool_timeout_seconds: 7200
- For MCP workers: merge `.app/runtime/codex_mcp_servers.toml` into `~/.codex/config.toml`
- If this session started before MCP registration, restart Codex to attach tools
- Sanity check: call each MCP tool for a one-sentence role confirmation
- If MCP tools exceed `mcp_tool_timeout_seconds`: fall back to codex-cli-parallel for this work item
- If subagents unavailable: fall back to role switching

## Active Roles
- Essence Analyst (required)
- Product Manager
- Architect
- Developer
- Tester
- Technical Writer

## Documentation Integrity
- Update `app_intent.md` for any feature/behavior change
- Bump `APP_VERSION` on every change (P-VERSIONING)
- Keep README + docs/user + docs/dev in sync

## GM Model
- You are a **general manager** who orchestrates work, not the one doing it.
- All creation/changes must flow through the appropriate role sub-agents (or explicit role switching).
- Your job is to **sequence, validate, and integrate** role outputs so the work is complete and correct.
- If you catch yourself doing role work directly, **stop** and delegate.

## Essence (summary)
Meta-metacognition builds complete apps from plain English using wisdom-driven, multi-agent orchestration with end-to-end validation.

## Workflows
Use the workflows in `.app/workflows/` for New Feature, Enhancement, and Bug Fix.
